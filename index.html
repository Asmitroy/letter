        <h1>Dear Harshitha,</h1>
        <p style="white-space: pre-line;">
I’ve been sitting with this letter for the past two days, thinking about how to put my feelings into words—how to make sure you know, without a shred of doubt, that you are not alone in this, that we are going to get through this together. I know things are overwhelming right now, that every day feels like a battle just to keep up. You’ve been juggling so much—family struggles, responsibilities, your course—and I see how much it’s taking out of you. And I know you’re exhausted. I know you feel stretched too thin, like no matter how hard you try, there’s never enough time. But even in all this chaos, I want you to know one thing: you are doing so much better than you think.

Even when life feels like a mess, even when you feel like you're barely holding it together, you're still moving forward. Your course is progressing, and that matters. I know it’s easy to feel like time is slipping away, like you’re losing moments that you can’t get back. But, in the grand scheme, nothing is being lost. This is just a tough season, and once it passes, we will reclaim our time. May will come with a breath of fresh air. We’ll have time to just be, to talk, laugh, make up for everything that feels rushed right now. We’re not missing out on anything, if anything you are working twice as hard to improve with course along with your family issues. We’re just waiting for the right time.

And through all of this, I want you to remember: I’m here. No matter how dark or heavy things get, I am always right here. You don’t have to carry everything alone. You don’t have to be strong all the time. When you feel like there’s no energy left, when everything feels like too much, lean on me and send me a text. Let me carry some of the weight, even if it’s just by reminding you that you are deeply, endlessly loved, not just me but by many more people in your life.

I’ve been meaning to tell you this for a while, and I never found the time before—but on January 3rd, I read the letter you sent me almost a year ago on Slowly. And, I can’t begin to tell you how much it meant to me. I had been meaning to reply for so long, but life kept getting in the way. Even now, I don’t think I can ever fully put into words how grateful I am for you, for that letter, for the way it made me feel. Whenever I feel low, tired or just anxious I find myself going back to it. Your words remind me that everything will be alright. They bring me peace, just like I hope my words do for you now.

So, if you ever feel like you're drowning, like you're alone in all of this—please, remember what you told me in that letter. The way your words reassured me? Let me do the same for you now. Everything will be okay. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon. This won’t last forever. Your family issues, the stress, the exhaustion—it will all fade one day, and you will finally have the peace you deserve. And I will be right there, beside you, through all of it.

I need you to take a deep breath for me now. Close your eyes, let go of the tension in your shoulders, and just be still for a moment. You are moving forward. You are loved. And no matter how chaotic life gets, no matter how lost you feel sometimes, you are never alone.

Rest, bbg. Let yourself breathe. I’ve got you.

Asmit</p>
